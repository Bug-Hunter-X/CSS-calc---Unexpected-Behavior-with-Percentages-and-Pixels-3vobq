# CSS calc() Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue with the CSS `calc()` function when using percentages and other units together. The problem lies in how `calc()` interacts with percentage values when the parent container's dimensions are not explicitly set or are affected by conflicting styles.

## Problem Description

The `calc()` function is supposed to allow for dynamic calculations within CSS. However, when combining percentages with other units like pixels, the calculation may be incorrect or unexpected if the containing element does not have its dimensions clearly defined or if other styles influence its size.

## Solution

The solution often involves ensuring that the parent container has a defined width (or height, depending on the context). Additionally, inspect for any conflicting CSS rules that might override or interfere with the `calc()` calculation.
